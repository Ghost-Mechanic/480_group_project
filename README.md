#This is a project for CS 480

You will notice that there are 3 different folders for the project: (all in alphabetical order)
- backend
- database
- frontend

With backend, there are different API calls to be made, so those are separated in scripts:
- db.js -> Gets the LOCAL database
- index.js -> Defines different routes / scripts used
- /routes/... -> Each stores a get / post HTTP request
    - Though we do not use the POSt HTTP request, it is included just in case...

To set up the backend, I did the following:
- cd backend
- npm install
- npm run dev

With the database, it well, ... stores the SQL query for creating the tables in the bookoverflow database. Honestly, there is not too much to say about it.

But, if you want to set up your database, I can't really say too much about it. I am using MySQLWorkbench to run my queries to create my database, tables, and schemas. If you want the actualt database file, then you can export it from ... I forgot. :|

For the front end, this is where the UI / UX can shine!
We did stright HTML / CSS / JS since it was the easiest to use!

To set up the front, I just do the following:
- Run the index.html file through the browser
So, similar to how you setup the backend. Okay, take care! :)
